 * This dialog was developed to handle situation where using standard RIE mechanism it's not possible.
 * It copies the standard RIE dialog.
 * So before using it, please make sure that there is no way to implement the standard.
 * Doesn't actually perform the rie, instead uses GC Core.RieMessage to pass the RIE message back to you.
 * I suggest using domain.markAsRie method
